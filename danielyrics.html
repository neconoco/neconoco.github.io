      <p>simple minds crave simple tasks<br />
        we're wearing animal masks drinking from rusty flasks<br />
        see how our feet are moving fast like lazier blasts!</p>
      <p>Go go go to the black and white show<br />
        feathers and leather don't go together <br />
        unless you push your chest out and get soaked in rainy weather<br />
        grow up!<br />
        Its a new day and hey! <br />
        don't you think you're old enough to know</p>
      <p>that everyone important is at the Black and White show?<br />
        Faces made of plastic rubber noses are elastic<br />
        ecstatic laughter from the rafters, what are those people after?<br />
        <br />
        Hey! I saw a dog playing a piano in the alleyway!<br />
        You don't believe the things I say? Why  are your lips so dry today?</p>
      <p>Children playing in the graveyard, hopping over unmarked graves<br />
        little Billy tripped while laughing, hasn't moved since yesterday</p>
      <p>fun is something we like doing<br />
        razor blades and shoelace string<br />
        Crumpled sheets and rotten apples <br />
        These are just my favorite things! </p>
      <p>Go Go GO to the Black and White show<br />
        Bearded women drinking whiskey making angels in the snow<br />
      This town hasn't slept in ages, we are wired like dirty bombs<br />

      <p>The plants are alive growing in the doorway<br />
        buzzing like a beehive broken in the hallway<br />
        clams and claws around my neck<br />
        must be something I forget<br />
        In the mud we kneel to pray<br />
        Melting figures made of clay</p>
      <p>Come on down and ride the lightning<br />
        Shocking thoughts are so exciting!<br />
        Wooden spoons on silver trays<br />
        We build castles every day</p>
      <p>Knock them down and dance all night<br />
        drink the gas in fire light<br />
        Pulsing waves of glowing haze<br />
        Spotlight searching through the maze<br />
        Find my hand with fingers crossed <br />
        Tangled up in hanging moss <br />
        Blindfolds on lets start to play<br />
    This is what I heard you say</p></td>

      <p>How can you believe in love?<br />
        When it has made you blind<br />
        With your hands stretched out<br />
        You feel your way toward me</p>
      <p>How many days go by without you?<br />
        Looking at the wall turning to noise like a rain the never stops<br />
        The dream is my creation but I know you were there<br />
        As long as you are with me then I don't care</p>
      <p>I see sudden flash of the mordent has long gone <br />
        Passed the taste of eternity never ever last<br />
        Lying the field of shadow of the light I breath you in</p>
      <p>This is, this is what it has to be <br />
        Like flapping wing it beats inside of me<br />
        Free to be, free to be without false vanity <br />
    I fall, I fall, falling up into the light<br />
    <br />

    <td height="9" align="center"><p><strong>Birds Under Valium</strong></p>
      <p>Down by the river where the water flows<br />
        There the hidden meadow where no one goes<br />
        If you close your eyes and take my hand</p>
      <p>I will take you there to the promised land <br />
        Where the glass is tall and sky is blue<br />
        We can stay forever just me and you</p>
      <p>Love is better when it's little bitter<br />
        A pinch of sadness make a smile sweeter<br />
        If I go now without saying goodbye <br />
        Will you vanish? forever like a dawn in the sky<br />
        And every time I fall a sleep I hear the sound of your wing<br />
        Dream so sweet nothing and juniper twigs</p>
      <p>Each passing clouds resembles your face <br />
        Like a line in a sand that I cannot erase <br />
    Rays of gold shining though the lips above<br />
And a bitter sweet cries of invisible dove<br />

      Blushing up against the glass<br />
    On a wall I watch their shadows <br />
    Moving as hour pass</p></td>
